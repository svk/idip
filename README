IDIP - IRC Diplomacy
by kaw, kaw.dev@gmail.com

Not in a playable state yet.

The idea here is supposed to be that IRC is an ideal platform for a social
game like Diplomacy, containing as it does semi-advanced features for
communication (dynamic creation of private channels, etc.) in a form many
people are very comfortable. It is a realtime protocol where people often
stay online for the majority of the day (idling), meaning that it suits
both live games and 'postal' games.

The bot will arrange games in a very casual, flexible fashion, e.g.
deadlines can be pushed back, state can be changed (to correct errors
in adjudication, to recreate a live game, ...) and so on, either by
having an appointed "administrating player", or by consensus between
the players. Of course, nothing that might constitute cheating can
ever be done without being logged and visible to all players.

The bot will also (someway, somehow) provide visualization through http,
ideally in SVG format. It will make some effort to ensure that valid and
sensible moves are submitted, even though some may feel that this
takes away a dimension from the game, to appear friendly to newcomers.

The game will be easily extensible to fit mere map-change variants.
